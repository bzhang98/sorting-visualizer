## Description

This Sorting Visualizer application is a tool designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work. It provides a visual representation of the sorting process, making it easier to grasp the concepts of each algorithm.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms
- Supports multiple algorithms with more to come
- User-friendly interface with controls to play, pause, and step through the sorting process
- Adjustable speed to control the visualization pace
- Options to adjust the initial data set to see how this impacts the performance of different algorithms
